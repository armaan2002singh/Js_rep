# JavaScript and classes.
### prototype-based language
#### Yes, javaScript has classes. This feature was introduced with the ECMAScriot in 2015 specification( often referred to as ES6). However, it's important to note that JavaScript is primarily a prototype-based language, and its classes are primarily syntactic sugar over existing prototype-based inheritance mechanisms. In other words, it provides a more familiar sytnax for developers coming from class-based language such as Java or C++, but under hood it works somewhat differently.
